## Descriptions of Git, Github, Repo, and Commit:
### Git
Git is the actual Version Control Software where you can run on any device. 
### Github
Github is a website service that uses and runs Git in the background. 
### Repo
A Repo is also called a repository, and it contains all your files, so it's more manageable. 
### Commit
A commit is like a save button, and it changes the file when it gets pressed. Each commit can be named with a note which can be used to keep track of what people are changing about the file. It also has a unique identifier to it called a hash.
